       <p>Child labour or child labor refers to the exploitation of children through any form of work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and is mentally, physically, socially or morally harmful.• The ILO has recently estimated that some 217.7 million children ages 5 to 17 are engaged
        in child labour around the world. Of these, some 126.3 million are caught in the worst
        forms of child labour.
        • Roughly 122.3 million children ages 5 to 14 are economically active in Asia and the Pacific,
        49.3 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 5.7 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 13.4
        million in other regions.
        • Among working children ages 5 to 14 in the world, 69% are employed in the agricultural
        sector, 9% are employed in the industrial sector and the remaining 22% are employed in
        the services sector.
        With 122.3 million economically active children ages 5 to 14, the Asia and the Pacific region has
        the highest number of working children worldwide. Many worst forms of child labour are a
        problem in the region, including child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, bonded child
        labour, child domestic work, hazardous child labour, and the recruitment and use of children for
        armed conflict or drug trafficking. A high tolerance for child labour in many countries and political
        volatility and conflict in certain others (e.g. Afghanistan, Nepal, Indonesia and Sri Lanka)
        exacerbate the problem and can hinder the implementation of action against it. In addition, a
        large number of children in areas affected by the tsunami in Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and
        India are vulnerable to entering child labour.
        • Results from the Bangladesh National Child Labour Survey (IPEC-SIMPOC, 2002-03)
        indicate that 3.4 million or 18.5% of males, ages 5-14, work and 1.3 million or 7.8% of
        females, of the same age group, work resulting in 4.7 million or 13.4% of all children, ages
        5-14, working.
        • The Cambodia Child Labour Survey (IPEC-SIMPOC, 2001) estimated that there were
        about 1,516,363 children aged 5-14 who can be considered “working children”, about
        44.8% of children in this age group. More boys than girls in the age groups 5-9 years old,
        10-14 years old and 15-17 years old were working children.
        • The total economically active child population between 5 and 17 years by current activity
        status was estimated at 68580 during 2002-03 in Mongolia. The overall child work rate is
        10.1 percent. For the child population of aged 5-14 years, the child work ratio is 7.2
        percent, but is considerably higher for the age group 15-17 years at 18.5 percent.

        • Among the 40 million children aged 5-14 years in Pakistan, 3.3 million, i.e. 8.3 per cent,
        were economically active in 1996.
        • Results from the Philippines Child Labour Survey (IPEC-SIMPOC, 2001) indicate that 1.4
        million or 13.4% of males, ages 5-14, work and 0.8 million or 8.4% of females, of the same
        age group, work resulting in 2.2 million or 11.0% of all children, ages 5-14,working.
        • In Sri Lanka, Child Activity Survey (1999) estimates that out of 4,344,770 children in the age
        group 5 - 17 years in Sri Lanka, 926,038 (21 percent) are engaged in some form of
        economic activity. The proportion of children who are engaged either in housekeeping
        activities or in education in addition to an economic activity is about 25 percent. The
        proportion of children engaged only in economic activities is 7.5%. The corresponding
        proportion for males is 9.4% and for females it is 4.2%. Out of all working children residing
        in the urban sector, 14.0% are engaged only in economic activities whereas the
        corresponding proportion in the rural sector is 7.1%.
