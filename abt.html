       <p>The coronavirus is also  known as covid 19.The reason i choose covid-19 was because it is a very dangerous virus. It can spread rapidly
           in crowds.The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated 
           . It is a respiratory disease. This disease can kill over thousands of people. 
           When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in
            air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
             droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. 
          
           You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone
            who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth
        and by hearing these things you can understand how dangerous it is.Thus we need to stop it from spreading.</p>
